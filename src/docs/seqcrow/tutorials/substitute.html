		<h1>Changing Substituents</h1>
			<p>
			In these tutorials, we'll see how SEQCROW can be used to efficiently edit the substituents of
			molecules. Some tutorials will make use of the 'Change Substituents' tool, while
			others will use the <code>substitute</code> command. These tutorials contain links that
			run ChimeraX commands to make some steps easier.

		<h2 id="TNT">Making TNT</h2>
			<p>
				In this tutorial, we're going to make 1,3,5-trinitrotoluene starting from benzene using
				SEQCROW's 'Change Substituents' tool. To begin, click the following command to open a
				benzene structure from a SMILES string (requires internet access):
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:open smiles:C1=CC=CC=C1">
					open smiles:C1=CC=CC=C1
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, open the 'Change Substituents' tool using the ribbon at the top of the screen:
				<ul>
					<li><a class="menulike">Tools &rarr; Structure Editing &rarr; Change Substituents</a></li> or
					<li><a class="menulike">Tools &rarr; AaronTools &rarr; Structure Modification</a></li>
				</ul>
				You may also click the command below to open the tool:
			</p>
			<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:ui tool show &quot;Change Substituents&quot;">
				<code>
					ui tool show "Change Substituents"
				</code>
			</a>
			<aside>
				<img src="../images/structureMod_Me.png"  style="width:256px"/>
			</aside>
			<p>
				First, we'll be turning this benzene structure into toluene. Then, we'll add the nitro groups.
				To make toluene, we need to replace one of the hydrogens with a methyl substituent. In the 
				'substituent name:' box on the tool window, enter "Me" or "CH3", the names of the methyl 
				substituent in the AaronTools library.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The substituents could have also been selected by clicking the 
				<button>from library...</button> button. This will open another window where you can search for
				substituents in the AaronTools library by name. Find the "Me" or "CH3" entry and click on it
				to fill in the "substituent name" box back on the main tool window. 
				This may be useful for discovering the available substituents or if you forget the name of 
				the one you are looking for.
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, select one of the hydrogens on the benzene structure. This can be done by 
				<kbd>CTRL</kbd>-clicking (with a non-Mac keyboard) or <kbd>command</kbd>-clicking (on a Mac keyboard)
				on one of the hydrogens.
			</p>
			<p>
				Regardless of the following options, you will still have a toluene structure in the end. But, 
				the result might be slightly different depending on the other options:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>modify selected structure</b> - if checked, the benzene structure you have open will
						be modified. If unchecked, a copy of the structure will be created and modified.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>relax substituent</b> - if checked, the substituent will be rotated about its bond
						to the rest of the molecule to try to mitigate any steric clashing.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>guess previous substituent</b> - this one doesn't matter here, but if you were 
						replacing, e.g., a methyl group with another substituent, checking this would allow you 
						to only select the carbon (or whichever substituent atom is bonded to the rest of the 
						molecule) instead of the entire substituent you are replacing. The largest group attached 
						to the selected atom wil be kept, while other groups are assumed to be part of the 
						substituent being replaced.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>use distance names</b> - if checked, the names of new atoms will be CA, CB, etc. 
						following the name of the atom the substituent is being attached to. This may be 
						useful when modifying peptides for a structure in preparation for a molecular
						dynamics simulation, which often require specific atom names. <b>NOTE</b> - these atom 
						names are generated automatically, and should be double-checked if specific
						atom names are required.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>new residue</b> - if checked, put the new substituent in its own residue. If unchecked,
						substituent atoms will be added to the same residue as the selected atoms.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>change residue name</b> - set the name of whichever residue the substituent atoms
						are placed in to the specified name. There are some restrictions on valid residue names,
						but these will not be covered here.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				To create toluene, press the <button>substitute current selection</button> button on the tool. 
				Now, we just need to attach the nitro groups.
			</p>

			<p>
				Clear the "substituent name" box and enter "NO2" - this is the name of the nitro substituent. 
				Select the hydrogen atoms that are <i>ortho</i> or <i>para</i> to the methyl group. This is similar to
				before, but <kbd>CTRL</kbd>- or <kbd>command</kbd>-clicking on atoms will only allow you to select 
				one atom by default. An easy way to select more atoms is <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> 
				clicking or <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> clicking on atoms. Press the 
				<button>substitute current selection</button> again to create 1,3,5-trinitrotoluene.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>NOTE</b> - if the nitro groups are rotated strangely, it is possible to rotate them to be
				in the plane of the rest of the ring. On the "Right Mouse" tab of ChimeraX's toolbar, select
				"Bond rotation". Now, you can right click on a bond and drag up and down your screen to rotate
				that bond.

		<h2 id="OMe2">Turning 1-Pentene into Dimethyl Ether</h2>
			<p>
				In this tutorial, we will be turning 1-pentene into dimethyl ether. The following command will
				open a 1-pentene structure:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:open smiles:C=CCCC">
					open smiles:C=CCCC
				</a>
				<br>
				To make dimethyl ether, we'll be replacing everything but the methyl group with a methoxy group.
				While this is not the most efficient way to make dimethyl ether, this tutorial is an example of a
				case where you don't want to let SEQCROW guess your previous substituent.
			</p>
			<aside>
				<img src="../images/structureMod_OMe.png" style="width:256px"/>
			</aside>
			<p>
				First, open the tool window as described in the previous tutorial. Then, select everything
				except the methyl group. While this could be done by clicking the atoms one-by-one, there
				are more efficient methods:
				<ul>
					<li>Using the "Select" menu on the ribbon at the top of your screen
						<ol>
							<li><a class="menulike">Select &rarr; Chemistry &rarr; Substituents &rarr; CH3</a></li>
							<li><a class="menulike">Select &rarr; Invert</a></li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Using the <a class="cxcmd">select</a> command
						<ul>
							<li><a href="cxcmd:select ~Me" class="cxcmd">select ~Me</a></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, we'll replace the selected fragment with a methoxy group. On the tool window, ensure the
				'guess previous substituent' is not checked. This is explicitly telling SEQCROW to replace this
				atom selection with the new substituent, keeping the smaller methyl group.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enter "OMe" (the name of the methoxy substituent in the AaronTools library) in the "substituent name"
				box. Press <button>substitute current selection</button> to finish the modification.
			</p>
	
		<h2 id="simultaneous">Modifying Multiple Structures Simultaneously</h2>
			<aside>
				<img src="../images/claisen.png" style="width:256px"/>
				<br>
				A Claisen rearrangement is a sigmatropic rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether that
				results in a new C-C bond.
			</aside>
			<p>
				In this tutorial, we'll be modifying two minima for a Claisen rearrangement using
				the <a class="cxcmd">substitute</a> command. That is, running <a class="cxcmd">substitute</a>
				just once to modify two structures. While we could do this with the tool just as easily,
				we're using the <a class="cxcmd">substitute</a> command out of fairness. An astute reader may
				have already noticed that the tool runs the <a class="cxcmd">substitute</a> command.
			</p>
			<p>
				To start, we'll make sure all other structures are close and open a structure of 
				allyl vinyl ether and 4-pentenal:
				<br>
				<a href="cxcmd:close" class="cxcmd">close</a>
				<br>
				<a href="cxcmd:open smiles:C=CCOC=C" class="cxcmd">open smiles:C=CCOC=C</a>
				<br>
				<a href="cxcmd:open smiles:O=CCCC=C" class="cxcmd">open smiles:O=CCCC=C</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Initially, these structures will be right on top of each other, making it difficult to examine
				either. An easy way to split them up is by running the <a href="cxcmd:tile" class="cxcmd">
				tile</a> command.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I open these structures, atom @H4 on the allyl vinyl ether (model #1) would become
				@H7 on the 4-pentenal (model #2), depending on what reaction pathway is traversed. If 
				these structures were made by hand, it would be most convenient if the order of the 
				atoms was consistent. This would allow us to use one @H<i>n</i> atom specifier for both 
				structures. We'll tolerate this arbitrary ordering for the purpose of this tutorial.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <a class="cxcmd">substitute</a> command takes atom specifiers as the first argument and 
				one or more substituents as a keyword argument. To see all options for this command, run
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:help substitute">help substitute</a>. Each keyword argument 
				corresponds to an option on the tool, but the only required arguments are an atom selection 
				and the names of the new substituents. To put a methyl group at the positions indicated above:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:substitute #1@H4 #2@H7 substituents Me">
				substitute #1@H4 #2@H7 substituents Me</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				ChimeraX commands and keyword names can be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation uniquely
				identifies the command or keyword. So, the <a class="cxcmd">substitute</a> command 
				above can also be written as:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:sub #1@H4 #2@H7 sub Me">sub #1@H4 #2@H7 sub Me</a>
				<br>
				as long as there is no other command that starts with 'sub'.
			</p>
			<p>
				In principle, any number of structures can be modified at once.
			</p>
		
		<h2 id="multisub">Making Multiple Derivatives Simultaneously</h2>
			<aside>
				<img src="../images/structureMod_multi.png"  style="width:256px"/>
			</aside>
			<p>
				In this tutorial, we will be returning to the Claisen rearrangement from the previous section.
				Instead of just putting a methyl group on these structures, we'll be putting a methyl,
				ethyl, <i>iso</i>-propyl, <i>tert</i>-butyl, methoxy, and chloro. Open the structures using
				the commands in the previous section. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Next, select the positions we are modifying by picking them with your mouse or using the
				following command:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:select #1@H4 #2@H7">select #1@H4 #2@H7</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the tools, 'substituent name' box, enter "Me,  Et,  iPr,  tBu, OMe, Cl". Substituent names
				can be separated by commas like this to request different substitutions. However, 'modify 
				selected structure' must be unchecked. This will create a new structure for every substitution
				that was requested.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				After pressing <button>substitute current selection</button>, you should have a total of 14 models open: the
				two original structures and two more for each of the six substituents that were added. Run the 
				<a href="cxcmd:tile spacingFactor 2" class="cxcmd">tile spacingFactor 2</a> command to see them all.
			</p>
		
		<h2 id="residues">Changing Peptide Side Chains</h2>
			<p>
				As most amino acid side chains can be thought of as substituents, we can also use the 
				"Change Substituents" tool to mutate polypeptides. We'll be mutating a tyrosine to a 
				non-standard residue: <i>p</i>-acetylphenylalanine. To open the structure we'll be working with:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:open 7LCM">open 7LCM</a>
			</p>
			<aside>
				<img src="../images/structureMod_COCH3.png" style="width:256px"/>
			</aside>
			<p>
				Now, we'll select the oxygen on the one tyrosine in this structure:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:select :TYR@OH">select :TYR@OH</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, enter "COCH3" in the 'substituent name' box. Ensure 'use distance names' is checked.
				To my knowledge, there is no three letter code for <i>p</i>-acetylphenylalanine, so we
				can change the residue name to "FpAc" or something else. Press <button>substitute current
				selection</button> to complete the mutation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The COCH3 substituent comes with some hydrogens. One way to delete these is with
				the following command:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:delete COCH3 & H">delete COCH3 & H</a>
			</p>
