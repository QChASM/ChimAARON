        <h1>Building Structures</h1>
            <p>
                In order to study a reaction using computational methods, you must
                have the relevant structures. If you want to study a particular
                reaction with multiple different substrates, it may also be useful
                to ensure that atoms are in the same order in the reactants,
                products, intermediates, and transition state structures. When the
                atoms are in the same order, it becomes easier to, for example,
                put a methyl group on the same site in all your structures later.

                A Claisen rearrangement is a sigmatropic rearrangement of
                an allyl vinyl ether that results in a new C-C bond.

                In this tutorial, we'll build allyl vinyl ether and
                4-pentenal, starting with the ether. To make editing
                these structures later a lot easier, we'll also
                try to keep the order of the atoms consistent in
                both structures.
            </p>
            <h3>Allyl Vinyl Ether</h3>
                <p>
                    To begin, open the tool for AaronTools structure
                    modification:
                    <br>
                    <span class="menulike">Tools &rarr; AaronTools &rarr; Structure Modification
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    or run the command:
                    <br>
                    <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:ui tool show &quot;Structure Modification&quot;">
                    ui tool show "Structure Modification"
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, switch to the "change element" tab on the tool window. 
                    This tab lets you change an atom's element or VSEPR shape.
                    We'll start with the vinyl group and work our way around
                    the structure. The first carbon atom ought to have a
                    trigonal planar VSEPR shape. Find this on the "geometry"
                    dropdown menu. These items are sorted by number of bonds,
                    so trigonal planar will be a few entries above the
                    default tetrahedral on this list. Once you've got that
                    selected, press <button>place in</button> with
                    <button>new structure</button> selected. You should
                    now have a trigonal planar CH<sub>3</sub> on the graphics
                    window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Continue building by picking one of the hydrogens and
                    replacing it with another trigonal planar carbon. You can
                    select with your mouse by <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-clicking or 
                    <kbd>command</kbd>-clicking on the atom. Pressing
                    <button>change selected elements</button> will replace
                    these atoms with a trigonal planar carbon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is very likely that the CH<sub>2</sub> groups will 
                    not be in the same plane. To rectify this, go over to 
                    the "Right Mouse" tab on the ChimeraX toolbar and pick 
                    "Bond rotation". Starting a right-click drag on the C=C 
                    bond and moving your mouse up and down the screen will 
                    rotate the bond.
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <img src="../images/periodic_table.png" style="width:256px"/>
                </aside>
                <p>
                    Let's move on to the oxygen. Back on the tool window,
                    click the "element" option's "C" to open a periodic 
                    table. Select oxygen. Change the "geometry" option to
                    "tetrahedral (2 bonds)", which will be a few entries above
                    trigonal planar. Finally, select one of the hydrogens
                    and press <button>change selected elements</button>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Switch the selected element back to carbon by clicking
                    on the element selector and picking carbon on the
                    periodic table. Also change the "geometry" option back
                    to "tetrahedral". Select the hydrogen on the oxygen and
                    turn it into carbon.
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <img src="../images/allyl_vinyl_ether.png" style="width:256px"/>
                </aside>
                <p>
                    Switch geometry back to "trigonal planar" and add the
                    last two atoms. Rotate bonds as necessary to eliminate
                    any close contacts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This structure should now be saved to a file. You can 
                    do this in a number of ways: <span class="menulike">
                    File &rarr; Save...</span> on the ribbon at the top of
                    your screen, the "Save" floppy disk on the "Home" tab
                    of the ChimeraX toolbar, the <a class="cxcmd"
                    href="cxcmd:help newTab save">save</a> command,
                    or prepare an optimization job using the input file
                    builder <span class="menulike">Tools &rarr;
                    AaronTools &rarr; Build QM Input</span>.
                </p>
            <h3>4-Pentenal</h3>
                <p>
                    Instead of starting this structure from scratch,
                    we'll just be editing the bonds and VSEPR geometry
                    of our allyl vinyl ether. This has the benefit of
                    keeping all the atoms in the same order, so if
                    we want to, for example, look at this reaction
                    using various substrates later, we'll be able to
                    build them quickly. You can use either the "Bond 
                    Editor" tool or the "Bond" mouse mode, which
                    can be activated on the "Right Mouse" tab of the
                    ChimeraX toolbar. The bond editor tool can be access via:
                    <br>
                    <span class="menulike">Tools &rarr; Structure Editing
                    &rarr; Bond Editor</span>
                    <br>
                    or the command:
                    <br>
                    <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:ui tool show &quot;Bond Editor&quot;">
                    ui tool show "Bond Editor"
                    </a>
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <img src="../images/allyl_vinyl_bond.gif"/>
                </aside>
                <p>
                    We'll add a bond between the CH<sub>2</sub> groups on either
                    end of the allyl vinyl ether. Use the bond rotation 
                    right mouse mode to rotate torsions so that the two
                    ends are closer together. Select the carbons of the 
                    two CH<sub>2</sub>'s and press <button>draw bond
                    between selected atoms</button> on the bond editor
                    tool. Next, select the bond between the oxygen and 
                    the CH<sub>2</sub> next to it. Press <button>erase
                    selected bonds</button> to remove this bond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're using the "Bond" mouse mode, you can click and
                    drag from one atom to another to draw a bond, or click
                    a bond to delete it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the moment, this structure isn't looking very good.
                    But that will buff out quickly. Switch back to the 
                    structure modification tool. One at a time, select
                    the carbon atoms that now have four bonds and set their
                    VSEPR geometry to tetrahedral. That is, select "C" as the
                    element and "tetrahedral" as the geometry on the 
                    "change element" tab of the tool and press <button>
                    change selected elements</button> with either of the
                    carbon atoms selected. Next, select the CH<sub>2</sub>
                    on the end and set its VSEPR geometry to trigonal planar.
                    The structure should now look more like 4-pentenal,
                    and can be saved as before.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/pentenal.png" style="width:256px"/>
                <p>
                    We have basically pretended our allyl vinyl ether went through
                    a transition state structure in order to make our 4-pentenal
                    structure. Note that there are multiple possible (at least two
                    reasonable) transition state structures for a Claisen
                    rearrangement. For a plain allyl vinyl ether, these look like 
                    mirror  images of each other and do not lead to different products.
                    However, the transition state structures could lead to different
                    products if we start adding substituents. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although we stuck to the "change element" features
                    of the structure modification tool to build allyl
                    vinyl ether, we could have easily used the "substitute"
                    utility or the "Change Element" mouse mode as well. 
                    These, however, will be left as an excercise for the reader.
                </p>
