		<h1>ChimeraX Orientation</h1>
        <p>ChimeraX is a feature-rich application, but knowledge of all
        ChimeraX's utilities is not necessary to interact with 
        SEQCROW's tools. This ChimeraX orientation will highlight
        a few of the ChimeraX things that are useful for
        SEQCROW users to be aware of. 
        </p>
        <p>A useful tidbit for this
        page and other tutorials is that hyperlinks can run ChimeraX
        commands. For SEQCROW tutorials, these links are styled like this:
        <br>
        <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:help newTab open">help newTab open</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Getting Help</h2>
        <aside>
            <img src="../images/context.png"/>
        </aside>
        <p>
        ChimeraX has a good amount of documentation, much of which can be found
        on the <span class="menulike">Help</span> menu (i.e. the way
        you got to SEQCROW's tutorials).
        But there are more ways to quickly access the documentation for a particular tool
        or command.
        </p>
        <p>
        For tools, you can right click (or <kbd>control</kbd>+click if you only have one
        mouse button) on the tool to show a context menu.
        One of the options will be "Help".
        This will pull up the tool's documentation in the ChimeraX browser.
        If the help option is grayed out, the tool's developer hasn't added
        the documentation for it, but you might be able to find documentation elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
        For commands, there is the <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:help newTab help">help</a>
        command. 
        You can give this another command, and it will pull up the documentation
        in the browser or show you the usage in the Log tool.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you want to see what features a 3<sup>rd</sup> party bundle adds,
        check the toolshed.
        All commands commands, tools, etc. that a bundle adds will be listed
        under the "Release History" tab on the bundle's page.
        Note that this is just a list - usage information is not necessarily
        on the toolshed.
        </p>

		<h2>Opening Structures</h2>
        <p>
        There's a few ways to open a structure in ChimeraX:
        
        <ol>
            <li><span class="menulike">File &rarr; Open</span> on the ribbon at the top of the screen</li>
            <li>"Open" button on the "Home" tab of ChimeraX's toolbar</li>
            <li><span class="cxcmd">open</span> command</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        The first two options allow you to open files using an interactive file explorer.
        The open command can make use of a path to a file, but it can do a bit more than that.
        If you run <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:open 2v6a">open 2v6a</a>, it will open the structure for
        PDB ID 2v6a. You can also open structures from a URL, other online databases, or from a SMILES string:
        <br>
        <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:open smiles:CC=CCC=O">open smiles:CC=CCC=O</a>
        <br>
        See <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/user/commands/open.html#fetch" target="_blank">
        the ChimeraX documentation</a> for more details on this. 
        </p>
  
        <h2>Mouse Modes</h2>
        <p>
        Objects open in ChimeraX can be manipulated or measured using your mouse pointer.
        </p>
        <p>
        By default, the left mouse button can rotate the view.
        You can also select atoms or other objects by <kbd>control</kbd>+clicking
        to set your selection to that object, or <kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+clicking
        to toggle whether that object is selected.
        Selected items have a subtle green outline. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The default right mouse button will move the view side to side or up and down. 
        You can change this to something else on the "Right Mouse" tab of the ChimeraX
        toolbar.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you only have one mouse button, you can use <kbd>command</kbd>+click or 
        <kbd>Alt</kbd>+click instead of right clicking.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Model Panel</h2>
        <p>
        Anything that appears in the ChimeraX graphics window will also appear on the
        "Models" tool (model is the umbrella term for atomic structures, density maps,
        surfaces, generic shape data, etc.). 
        <br>
        <img src="../images/model_panel.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
        The Models tool shows you the name of each model, its ID, color, whether it is visible, and whether it is selected.
        It also allows you to change the color of the entire model, hide or show the model, and select or deselect the entire model.
        The next section has more on the model ID. Some models will have children. For example,
        A coordination complex will likey have the atoms and bonds in the 'parent' model and
        a separate 'child' model for the coordination bonds. In these cases, there will be a 
        small arrow next to the parent model. Clicking the arrow will show the model's children. 

        <h2>Specifiers and Selectors</h2>
        <p>
        Every object shown in the graphics window has a specifier associated with it.
        These specifiers can be used to set the scope of a command or tool to certain atoms or models.
        Selectors are similar, but can be used to select atoms or parts of models meeting certain criteria.
        A good way to play around with these is the <a class="cxcmd">select</a> command.
        </p>
        <h3>Atomic Structure Specifiers</h3>
        <p>
        For an entire model, the specifier is &quot;#<i>&lt;model ID&gt;</i>&quot;. For example, 
        you can select a model with ID 1 with <a href="cxcmd:select #1" class="cxcmd">select #1</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        An atom's specifier is &quot;@<i>&lt;atom name&gt;</i>&quot;.
        You can figure out an atom's name (or even its specifier, depending on your settings) by hovering your mouse over it.
        For example, to select all atoms named "C1" across all models, run:
        <br>
        <a href="cxcmd:select @C1" class="cxcmd">select @C1</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        If you only want to select atoms named "C1" on model #1, you can combine the atom specifier with the model specifier:
        <br>
        <a href="cxcmd:select #1@C1" class="cxcmd">select #1@C1</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        These can get more advanced. For full details, see
        <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/docs/user/commands/atomspec.html#hierarchy" target="_blank">
        the ChimeraX documentation</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Selectors</h3>
        <p>
        There are also "selectors" that can be invoked to select groups of atoms.
        These range in simplicity from element symbol to more complex things like functional groups.
        You can find selectors on ChimeraX's ribbon under "Select", though these work with the <span class="cxcmd">select</span> command as well.
        For example, to select all carbons you can either:
        <ul>
        <li>use the menu: <span class="menulike">Select &rarr; Chemistry &rarr; Element &rarr; C</span></li>
        <li>use the command <a href="cxcmd:select C" class="cxcmd">select C</a></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        There are also numerous functional group selectors in ChimeraX.
        SEQCROW expands this with related substituent selectors.
        These are under <span class="menulike">Select &rarr; Chemistry &rarr; Functional Group</span>
        and <span class="menulike">Select &rarr; Chemistry &rarr; Substituents</span>, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
        There's also a "sel" selector, which is for the current selection. 
        This may be useful if it's faster to pick atoms by clicking on them than
        to figure out what selectors or specifiers to use.
        For example, you can select two atoms with your mouse and run:
        <br>
        <a href="cxcmd:distance sel" class="cxcmd">distance sel</a>
        <br>
        to print the distance between those atoms to the log.
        </p>

        <h2>Saving Images</h2>
        <p>
        You can save an image of ChimeraX's graphics window in a couple ways:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="menulike">File &rarr; Save...</span> and choosing an
            image format (e.g. PNG, JPEG, TIFF) file type
            </li>
            <li>
            clicking the "Snapshot" button with the camera icon on the "Home"
            tab of the ChimeraX toolbar
            </li>
            <li>
            the <span class="cxcmd">save</span> command
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The <span class="menulike">File &rarr; Save...</span> and 
        <span class="cxcmd">save</span> command
        options are more flexible than snapshots. You can choose the image size,
        super sampling, and whether the background should be transparent (if the file
        type supports this).
        </p>
        <p>
        You might want to look at the graphical presets that are available under
        <span class="menulike">Presets</span> to see if you like any of them. 
        One thing worth noting: the selection outline will appear in any saved images.
        If you're trying to use the selection to make certain atoms or bonds
        stand out more, try using SEQCROW's <span class="cxcmd">highlight</span>
        command instead.
        </p>

        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <p>
        You can change some default values in the ChimeraX settings.
        For example, you might want to change the default color of distance labels
        from yellow to black.
        These can be found under <span class="menulike">Favorites &rarr; Settings...</span>
        or <span class="menulike">Preferences &rarr; Settings...</span> (depending on
        your operating system) on the ChimeraX ribbon at the top of the screen.
        Explore these to discover what you might want to change.
        You will have to press <button>Save</button>, or else the changes won't stick.
        </p>
