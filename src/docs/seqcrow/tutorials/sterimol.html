			<p>
				Sterimol parameters are useful for measuring the size of a substituent; they
				acknowledge that substituents are not one-dimensional. Several of these parameters
				have been shown to correlate with reactivity or selectivity, indicating that
				substituents on a catalyst are blocking the substrate or possibly pushing
				substrates together to facilitate bond formation. The Sterimol parameters that
				have proven to be most useful for building models to predict chemical behavior
				are B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>5</sub>, and L. For the original description,
				see 
				<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ps.2780070410">https://doi.org/10.1002/ps.2780070410</a>
		    </p>
			<p>
				The parameters B<sub>1</sub> to B<sub>4</sub> are defined based on a bounding
				box of the van der Waals radii of the substituent atoms projected onto a plane
				perpendicular to the bond between the molecule and the substituent. Once the
				bounding box with the shortest distance from the molecule-substituent bond and
				one of its sides is found, B<sub>1</sub> is the shortest distance from the
				molecule-substituent bond and the bounding box. B<sub>2</sub>-B<sub>4</sub>
				are the lengths from the molecule-substituent to the other sides of the 
				bounding box, sorted in increasing order. The B<sub>5</sub> parameter is the
				greatest distance from the molecule-substituent bond and the projected
				VDW radii. The B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>5</sub> parameters respectively 
				measure the	minimum and maximum width of the substituent.

				Note the difference in the starting point of the blue arrow.
			</aside>
			<p>
				The L parameter is the distance from the substituent atom that is bonded to
				the rest of the molecule to the furthest projected VDW radius projected onto
				the molecule-substituent bond vector. In the old FORTRAN implementation,
				an additive correction is made to account for the substituent being bonded to
				a standard carbon atom. This correction is 0.4 Å + the ideal bond length
				between the first substituent atom and a hydrogen (it was required that
				the substituent be capped with a hydrogen). AaronTools uses a 
				different correction by default: simply the van der Waals radius of the
				first substituent atom. Either way, the L parameter effectively measures
				the "length" of the substituent.

				In these tutorials, you'll see how to calculate the Sterimol parameter for
				substituents using SEQCROW.

		<h2 id="iPr">Calculating Sterimol Parameters for <i>i</i>Pr</h2>
			<p>
				We'll start with one substituent at a time. To begin we'll open up a
				structure with an isopropyl substituent. The simplest structure is
				<i>n</i>-propane (H-<i>i</i>Pr). Ideally, we would use an optimized
				structure, but we'll settle for a generated one for this tutorial.
				Click the command below to open a propane structure:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:open smiles:C(C)C">open smiles:C(C)C</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now let's open the Sterimol tool, which is found under
				<span class="menulike">Tools &rarr; Structure Analysis &rarr; Substituent Sterimol</span>
				or by running the command:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:ui tool show &quot;Substituent Sterimol&quot;">
				ui tool show "Substituent Sterimol"
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				We've got a few options when we calculate Sterimol parameters. The only
				two that affect the parameter values are the radii and whether or not
				to use the FORTRAN-style L (see description above). The two radii options,
				UMN and Bondi, will give similar results. The main difference is that UMN
				has better coverage of the periodic table, but Bondi is used more
				frequently in the literature. For now, we'll just leave those on the
				default. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The other options, 'show vectors' and 'show radii', allow for visualization
				of the parameters. We will check both of those boxes.
			</p>
			<p>
				To calculate the Sterimol parameters, we need to select the <i>i</i>Pr
				portion of this structure. This is simple enough with the iPr selector,
				found under <span class="menulike">Selection &rarr; Chemistry &rarr;
				Substituents &rarr; iPr</span> or by running the command:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:select iPr">select iPr</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, simply press <button>calculate parameters for selected substituents</button>.
				The table on the lower half of the table will now have an entry for this substituent.
				You should get the following results:
				<br>
				<table style="border: 1px solid #5c5c5c; text-align:center;">
					<tr>
						<th style="border: 1px solid #5c5c5c;">Parameter</th>
						<th style="border: 1px solid #5c5c5c;">Value (Å)</th>
					</tr>

		<h2 id="more">Calculating Parameters for Multiple Substituents</h2>
			<p>
				In order to build a model relating Sterimol parameters to reactivity,
				you would have to calculate the parameters for several substituents.
				In this tutorial, you'll see how this can be accomplished efficiently
				in SEQCROW.
			</p>
			<p>
				To begin, we'll open structures for several substituents (again,
				it would be better if these were optimized structures). Click the
				command below to load a few structures:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:open smiles:C smiles:CC smiles:C(C)C smiles:C(C)(C)C smiles:C1=CC=CC=C1 smiles:CF smiles:C(F)F smiles:C(F)(F)F smiles:CCl smiles:C(Cl)Cl">
				open smiles:C smiles:CC smiles:C(C)C smiles:C(C)(C)C smiles:C1=CC=CC=C1 smiles:CF smiles:C(F)F smiles:C(F)(F)F smiles:CCl smiles:C(Cl)Cl
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, to visualize these more clearly, we'll reorient the structures so that we
				are looking down the substituent-molecule bond and split them up (this is optional).
				We're counting @H1 as the molecule in each of these structures, so:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:lookDown @C1 atom2 @H1">lookDown @C1 atom2 @H1</a>
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:tile spacingFactor 2">tile spacingFactor 2</a>
				<br>
				We can also change the camera to eliminate the parallax effect:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:camera ortho">camera ortho</a>
				<br>
				(To return to the default camera style, run <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:camera mono">camera mono</a>)
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, we just need to select the substituents. A concise way of doing this is
				with the command
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:select ~@H1">select ~@H1</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, we can just press <button>calculate parameters for selected substituents</button>.
				If you'd also like a good view of the L parameters, you can run 
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:lookDown @C1 atom2 @H1 axis x">lookDown @C1 atom2 @H1 axis x</a>
				<b>BEFORE</b> calculating Sterimol parameters (the <span class="cxcmd">lookDown</span>
				command does not reorient the spheres or arrows).
			</p>
			<p>
				These parameters can now be exported to a CSV file using the
				<span>Export</span> menu on the tool window. Be sure to make
				a note of which model id corresponds to which substituent.
				From there, you can set up your regression model or do
				other data processing.
