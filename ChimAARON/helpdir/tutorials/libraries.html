<h2>Browse AaronTools Libraries</h2>

<p>
To browse the AaronTools Ligand, Substituent, and Ring Fragment libraries in Chimera, open the <span class="menulike">AaronTools Libraries</span> menu under <span class="menulike">Tools</span> &rarr; <span class="menulike">ChimAARON</span>.
<br><br>
The Ligand Library can be sorted by ligand name, denticity, or the elements of coordinating atoms. 
You have the option to highlight the ligands key atoms. 
<br><br>
Items in the Substituent Library can be sorted by name and conformer information. 
You can choose to show a ghost bond to see where the substituent would connect to a molecule. 
<br><br>
Ring Fragments can be sorted by name only.
You can choose to see the direction AaronTools will walk around the ring when it's being mapped onto another structure.

<p>
In the menu shown above, three ligands are selected. 
All of these coordinate to a catalyst center with two oxygen atoms (per the "<span class="menulike">Coordinating Elements</span>" column).
Pressing <span class="buttonlike">Open selected ligands</span> results in a scene similar to the one shown below. 
The <span class="menulike">Highlight key atoms</span> box is checked, meaning the key oxygen atoms will have spheres drawn around them. 
These don't show up well on the widget, so a sphere in the center has been added to show where a catalyst center (<i>i.e.</i> transition metal) would be instead.
