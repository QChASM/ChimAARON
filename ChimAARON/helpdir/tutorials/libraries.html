<h2>Browse AaronTools Libraries</h2>

<p>
To browse the AaronTools Ligand, Substituent, and Ring Fragment libraries in Chimera, open the <span class="menulike">AaronTools Libraries</span> iterface under <span class="menulike">Tools</span> &rarr; <span class="menulike">ChimAARON</span>.
The Ligand Library can be sorted by ligand name, denticity, or the elements of coordinating atoms. 
Items in the Substituent Library can be sorted by name and conformer information.
Ring Fragments can be sorted by name only.
</p>

In the menu shown above, three ligands are selected. 
All of these coordinate to a catalyst center with two oxygen atoms (per the "<span class="menulike">Coordinating Elements</span>" column).
Pressing <span class="buttonlike">Open selected ligands</span> results in the scene shown below. 
The sphere in the center has been added to show where a catalyst center (<i>i.e.</i> transition metal) would be.

To quickly look at many ligands at once, you can load in all the ligands you want to compare. 
You can then use the Tile Structures tool in Chimera to spread them out. 
Below is the result for loading in many bisphosphine ligands in this way. 
It may be more straightforward to compare them after selecting the key atoms, using ChimAARON's  
<a href="../commands/rmsdalign.html"><code>rmsdalign</code></a>, and tiling the structures.
