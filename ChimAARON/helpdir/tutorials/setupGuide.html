<h2>Setting up AaronTools</h2>

<p>
Almost all of the functionality added by ChimAARON is based on our AaronTools Python 3 module. 
The AaronTools installation that comes with ChimAARON is compatible with Python 2, which is what Chimera uses.
</p>

<h3>Adding the ChimAARON Plugin</h3>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b> - you may experience some issues using ChimAARON if AaronTools is installed in a cloud-synced directory, like a Dropbox folder.
</p>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>To add ChimAARON as a Chimera plugin, go to <span class="menulike">Tools</span> &rarr; <span class="menulike">Additional Tools</span> &rarr; <span class="menulike">Add third-party plugin location...</span>
	<ul><li>This will open a dialog menu, in the bottom half of which you can specify the location of plugin folders</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Press <span class="buttonlike">Add...</span> and navigate your way to the directory containing your ChimAARON and AaronTools directories (<i>e.g.</i> 'plugins' for /home/CoolUser/plugins/AaronTools and /home/CoolUser/plugins/ChimAARON)</li>
	<ul><li>Pressing <span class="buttonlike">Open</span> will add that location to the "Third-party plugin locations" box</li>
		<li>Check to make sure the location is set correctly (for our CoolUser example, you'd see "&bull; plugins - /home/CoolUser" or "&bull; /home/CoolUser/plugins" depending on a setting in your <span class="menulike">General Preferences</span>)</li>
		<li>Make sure to press <span class="buttonlike">Save</span></li>
</ol>
Chimera is now able to discover AaronTools and ChimAARON. 
Now, we just need some AaronTools dependencies.
</p>

<h3>Installing Dependencies</h3>

<p><b>
If you installed Chimera in a directory that requires administrator/root privileges to modify, you'll need to run Chimera as an administrator/super user for this.
</b></p>

<p>
AaronTools uses one Python module that doesn't come with Chimera: <code>`future`</code>. 
If you're comfortable installing this manually, feel free to do so. 
A simpler option is to go through ChimAARON. 
Go to <span class="menulike">Tools</span> &rarr; <span class="menulike">ChimAARON</span> &rarr; <span class="menulike">Set up AaronTools</span>.
This menu option will go away if ChimAARON does not run into any errors when importing AaronTools.
</p>

<p>
You will see a dialog menu with buttons that simplify the setup process.
</p>

<p>
ChimAARON utilizes pip to install the AaronTools dependencies, so first you'll want to press <span class="buttonlike">install pip with ensurepip and update pip</span>. 
Check Chimera's reply log to make sure pip was installed and/or updated to the newest version. 
</p>

<p>
Once you've got pip, press <span class="buttonlike">install dependencies</span> to install <code>`future`</code>.
</p>


<h3>Personal Library</h3>
<p>
To specify the location of your personal AaronTools library, press set AARONLIB location. This will open a directory explorer.
Navigate to your personal library directory and select it.
You will have to restart Chimera before using your personal library. 
</p>

<h3>Backporting AaronTools</h3>

<p><b>
If you are using the AaronTools installation that comes with ChimAARON, you should not need to do this
</b></p>

<p>
We use the pasteurize script that comes with <code>`future`</code> to fix most of AaronTools' compatibility issues between Python 2 and 3. 
To run this script on AaronTools, press <span class="buttonlike">pasteurize AaronTools</span>. 
Monitor Chimera's reply log to make sure this finishes without issue. 
</p>

<p>
Once pasteurize finishes, we still need to fix a couple of things that pasteurize doesn't catch. 
Simply press <span class="buttonlike">fix misc. backporting</span>.
</p>

<p>
Now you should just have to restart Chimera for all of the ChimAARON tools to start functioning!
