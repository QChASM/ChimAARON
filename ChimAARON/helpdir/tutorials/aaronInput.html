<h2>Creating an AARON Input File</h2>

<p>
Begin by going to <span class="menulike">Tools</span> &rarr; <span class="menulike">ChimAARON</span> &rarr; <span class="menulike">Set up AARON Input...</span>.
This will open a dialog asking you to select a source for your TS templates. 
</p>

<h3>Selecting TS Template Source</h3>
<p>
AARON input files require that you specify a TS template. 
There are three options for loading TS template structures into Chimera:
<ol>
	<li>loading from the TS template library (not implemented)</li>
	<li>using molecules that are currently loaded into Chimera</li>
	<li>resume a previous input from your current session (only available when an input recording has been started)</li>
</ol>

If you are using structures from your TS library, simply select the <span class="menulike">Reaction type</span> and <span class="menulike">Template</span>.
<br><br>
If you are using structures that are loaded in Chimera, select them on the table so that the table entries are highlighted in blue. 
You may also enter names for the <span class="menulike">Reaction type</span> and <span class="menulike">Template</span>, but this is not necessary for getting to the next stage.
<br><br>
You can also choose a name for the AARON input recording, which can be used to resume working on an AARON input file after you close the dialog.
<br><br>
Press <span class="buttonlike">Apply</span> to move on to the next stage.
</p>

<h3>AARON Input Recorder</h3>
<p>
In this dialog, you have options for swapping the ligand, changing substituents, and setting keywords for the AARON input file. 
On the right side, you can see the contents of the AARON input file. 
The input file contents will update if you make any changes.
</p>

<h4>Ligand the Swapping</h4>
<p>
For swapping the ligand, you must specify the key atoms on the current ligand. 
You can type in the Chimera OSL atom selection in the <span class="menulike">Key atoms</span> box. 
Alternatively, you can select atoms by another means and press <span class="buttonlike">current selection</span> to fill in the <span class="menulike">Key atoms</span> box with the OSL specifiers for your current selection. 
<br><br>
You can specify the new ligand by entering the ligand's libary name in the <span class="menulike">Ligand</span> box. 
You can also press <span class="buttonlike">From library...</span> to open a dialog that lists the ligands in the library. 
If you press <span class="buttonlike">OK</span> with ligands selected in the ligand library dialog, the <span class="menulike">Ligand</span> box will be filled in automatically.
<br><br>
Pressing <span class="buttonlike">map ligand</span> will swap the current ligand for a new one. 
You should also see a new entry in the <span class="menulike">&Ligands</span> section of the input file. 

</p>

<h4>Changing Substituents</h4>
<p>
For changing a substituent, you must specify the position you're adding a substituent. 
You can type in the Chimera OSL atom selection in the <span class="menulike">Atom selection</span> box. 
Alternatively, you can select atoms by another means and press <span class="buttonlike">current selection</span> to fill in the <span class="menulike">Atom selection</span> box with the OSL specifiers for your current selection. 
<br><br>
You can specify the substituent by entering the substituent's libary name in the <span class="menulike">Substituent</span> box. 
You can also press <span class="buttonlike">From library...</span> to open a dialog that lists the substituents in the library. 
If you press <span class="buttonlike">OK</span> with substituents selected in the substituent library dialog, the <span class="menulike">Substituent</span> box will be filled in automatically.
<br><br>
Pressing <span class="buttonlike">substitute</span> will add the substituent. 
If the atom selection is on the ligand, you should see a new entry in the <span class="menulike">&Ligands</span> section of the input file. 
If the atom selection is on the substrate, you should see a new entry in the <span class="menulike">&Substrates</span> section of the input file. 
If the atom selection is on a molecule that has already been substituted, the new entry will contain instructions for both substitutions. 
</p>

<h4>Input Keywords</h4>
<p>
Select the keyword you'd like to add or modify from the <span class="menulike">Keyword</span> dropdown menu. 
Fill the value of the keyword into the blank and press <span class="buttonlike">set</span> to add/modify the keyword in the input file, or press <span class="buttonlike">unset</span> to remove the keyword from the input file.
<br><br>
See the <a href="https://github.com/QChASM/Aaron/wiki/More-on-AARON-Input-Files">AARON GitHub wiki</a> for more details about input file keywords.
</p>

<h3>Saving Your Input File</h3>
<p>
Currently, there is not option for saving the contents of the AARON input to a file. 
However, you can copy the <span class="menulike">Input</span> and paste it into a file.
