Welcome to the ChimAARON User's Guide! 
Here, you can find tutorials on using the functionality added in the ChimAARON plugin.
You can also find details about ChimAARON tools and commands. 
Many of the features added in this plugin are built off of our AaronTools Python module. 
Information about AaronTools and AARON can be found on the QChASM GitHub page, or on the QChASM website.
</p>

<p>
ChimAARON aims to add features that are useful for setting up AARON, and modifying and representing small systems that are studing using quantum mechanical methods.

A few notes about the formatting found in this user guide:
<ul>
<li>names of menu options are denoted by a gray background like <span class="menulike">this</span></li>
<li>menu options that require additional information before loading the desired tool have an ellipsis like <span class="menulike">this...</span></li>
<li>buttons on dialogs also have a gray background, but they have a border like <span class="buttonlike">this</span></li>
<li>commands that can be entered on the Chimera command line will usually be formatted like <code>this</code></li>
<li>names of Python functions/subroutines are formatted the same as commands, but end with parenthesis like <code>this()</code></li>
</ul>
